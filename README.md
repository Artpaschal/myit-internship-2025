# MYIT Consult Internship Projects  

This repository documents my work as part of the **MYIT Consult Internship Programme (Data, Research & Development Track)**.  

Over the course of the internship, I contributed to three distinct research-driven projects that demonstrate my application of quantitative and qualitative methodologies, as well as problem-solving in real-world contexts.  

## Projects
