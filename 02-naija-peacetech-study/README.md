# Naija PeaceTech Lab Youth Study  

## Problem Statement  
Nigeria’s conflict dynamics are increasingly mediated through digital spaces. Youth (15–40 yrs), who make up the majority of the population, are both vulnerable to online conflict triggers and potential drivers of peace through technology.  

## Research Questions  
**Primary:**  
1. How do Nigerian youth use digital tools to engage in peacebuilding or conflict-related activities?  
2. What factors (gender, access to tech, exposure to conflict) influence youth engagement in peace-oriented digital behaviors?  

**Secondary:**  
- What are the barriers to using tech for peacebuilding?  
- How do urban vs rural youth differ in digital peace practices?  
- What role do social media platforms play in shaping perceptions of conflict?  

## Research Design  
- **Method:** Quantitative survey-based approach  
- **Sampling:** Stratified random sampling across regions, gender, and urban/rural demographics  
- **Analysis:** Descriptive + inferential statistics  

## Expected Outcomes  
- Evidence-based insights into how Nigerian youth navigate digital spaces in conflict contexts.  
- Inputs for co-designing PeaceTech interventions.
